# Skyspecs Assignment
This readme will contain some thoughts and choices in note format I made along the way. I'm writing in English because I forgot to write most of my notes in Danish, so I'm just continuing the habit.

1. My first choice was opting to hardcode the entire thing for starters to get an idea of visualization prior to beginning the actual coding, at least this was my plan. I opted to hardcode it, so I knew how the formatting should be when I would code it dynamically. Hardcoding it gave me a great idea of the format, so after that all I had to do was add some functionalities.

2. My next choice was opting to change all the img elements to css ::before elements instead, while this simplified the overall addition of images to specific elements, in hindsight I would've rather opted to do it through JavaScript by iterating specific elements and adding <img> elements through that.

3. After this, I started coding the JS part of it. The initial coding was easy, I opted to try to limit myself from doing too much in JS, because the goal of the assignment seemed fixed on being design-based. Though with that said, I coded the functionality for clicking and thus selecting a different active element, and opening/closing parent boxes.

4. As mentioned in 1, my original intent was to make it dynamic based on a json file. I opted to make the json file in the end, because I wanted to show how I intended for the json to look. As mentioned, I don't know the inner workings of a windmill, therefore I wasn't sure what to call each layer going down. In the end I chose not to go with the dynamic coding, because I was concerned it would take too much extra time.

5. As visible in the css, I ended up not using any @media or mostly no -moz/-o etc. parameters. This was simply by choice of aiming to finish the assignment in due time prior to the deadline.

That's about what I had to say in terms of notes, please enjoy.
